                            Being located below the equator, Madagascar has its summers 
                            from November to March and winters from May to October.

                            Because of how Madagascar split from the african continent 88 million years ago, 
                            Madagascar is home to many organisms that aren't found anywhere else in the world.
                            This makes Madagascar very unique and a hotspot for studying ecology.
                            Approximately 90% of all plant and animal species found in Madagascar are "endemic"
                            meaning they are found only in Madagascar and nowhere else in the world.

                            More than 80 percent of Madagascar's 14,883 plant species are found nowhere else in the world, 
                            including five plant families. One of these five, the Didiereaceae family, composed of four genera and 11 species, 
                            is limited to the spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar.
                            Madagascar is also host to 6 of 9 types of Baobab trees in the world and its "Avenue of the Baobabs" 
                            is one of Madagascar's most prominent tourist attractions.

                                Lemurs are primates that look like an animal in between a dog, a cat and a squirrel 
                                that have incredibly unique and exciting behaviors that include singing like a whale. 
                                There are more than thirty species of lemurs in Madagascar today that vary in size 
                                from the 25 grams pygmy lemur to the largest Indri Lemur weighing more than 12 kgs. 
                                Lemurs are one of the most threatened animals in the whole planet and according to 
                                IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, 22 species of lemurs are critically endangered, 
                                48 are endangered, while 20 are vulnerable.

                                Tomato frogs are found only in Madagascar, mainly in the northwestern region of the 
                                island and are chiefly terrestrial, living in the forested areas. Due to 
                                deforestation, their habitat has been destroyed but seemingly they adapt well to the 
                                cultivated areas, and they are common in gardens. They are brightly colored and ooze 
                                off some white sticky mucus when threatened, though they are not toxic, they are 
                                irritating to the mucous membrane.

                                The panther chameleon is native to Madagascar and has been introduced to other 
                                islands in the surroundings. It is one of the most colorful with widest color 
                                variations of all the chameleons, they are also larger and the most sought after by 
                                reptile keepers and traders. Like other Chameleons, panther chameleon has a bony 
                                extension on the rear part of its head called the casque. It hunts and traps its pray 
                                using its extensile tongue that has specialized muscles that propels the tongue to 
                                snare by use of sticky mucus and vacuum created by the muscles at the tip of the tongue.

                    Madagascar can be divided into five general geographical regions: the east coast, the 
                    Tsaratanana Massif, the Central Highlands, the west coast, and the southwest. The highest 
                    elevations parallel the east coast.
                    <h5 class="mt-2">East coast</h5>
                    The east coast consists of a narrow band of lowlands about fifty kilometers wide, 
                    formed from the sedimentation of alluvial soils, and an intermediate zone composed of 
                    steep bluffs alternating with ravines bordering an escarpment of about 500 metres 
                    (1,640 ft) in elevation, which gives access to the Central Highlands. The coastal 
                    region roughly from north of Baie d'Antongil, the most prominent feature on the 
                    Masoala Peninsula, to the far north of the island. The coastline is straight, with 
                    the exception of a bay, offering less in the way of natural harbors than the west 
                    coast.
                    <h5 class="mt-2">Tsaratanana Massif</h5>
                    The Tsaratanana Massif region at the north end of the island contains, at 2,880 
                    metres, the highest point on the island. Further north is the Montagne d'Ambre, which 
                    is of volcanic origin. The coastline is deeply indented; two prominent features are 
                    the natural harbor at Antsiranana, just south of the Cap d'Ambre, and the large 
                    island of Nosy Be to the west. The mountainous topography of the Tsaratanana Massif 
                    limits the potential of the port at Antsiranana by impeding the flow of traffic from 
                    other parts of the island.
                    <h5 class="mt-2">Central Highlands</h5>
                    The Central Highlands, which range from 800 to 1,800m in altitude, contain a wide 
                    variety of topographies: rounded and eroded hills, massive granite outcrops, extinct 
                    volcanoes, eroded peneplains, and alluvial plains and marshes, which have been 
                    converted into irrigated rice fields. The Central Highlands extend from the 
                    Tsaratanana Massif in the north to the Ivakoany Massif in the south. They are defined 
                    rather clearly by the escarpments along the east coast, and they slope gently to the 
                    west coast.
                    <h5 class="mt-2">West Coast</h5>
                    The west coast, composed of sedimentary formations, is more indented than the east 
                    coast, thus offering a number of harbors sheltered from cyclones, such as the harbor 
                    at Mahajanga. Deep bays and well-protected harbors have attracted explorers, traders, 
                    and pirates from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East since ancient times; thus, the 
                    area has served as an important bridge between Madagascar and the outside world. 
                    Silting up of harbors on this coast, caused by sediment from the high levels 
                    erosion suffered inland in Madagascar, is a major problem.
                    <h5 class="mt-2">Southwest</h5>
                    The southwest is bordered on the east by the Ivakoany Massif and on the north by the 
                    Isala Roiniforme Massif. It includes two regions along the south coast, the Mahafaly 
                    Plateau and the desert region occupied by the Antandroy people.

            <!--------------------------------- More Climate Information --------------------------------->

            <div class="container-fluid">
                <h2>More on Climate</h2>
                <h5>Winter/Dry Season</h5>
                <p>
                During the dry winter months of April through early September, the days are warm, but 
                the nights can become very cold! Although it is the dryer season, you can expect some 
                rainfall during the beginning of our itinerary when we explore the rain forests of the east coast.
                Many travelers think that, because they are traveling to Africa, it will most likely 
                be warm. This is not the case at night and early morning from May through September—
                particularly in June, July and August. The nights and early mornings can be chilly 
                (possibly near freezing), so we recommend bringing warm layers you can “peel” off as 
                it warms up throughout the day. A warm jacket or fleece pullover is perfect.
                </p>
                <h5>Summer/Green Season</h5>
                <p>
                Late September through April is a much warmer period, and you will need fewer warm 
                clothes, although you can still expect cooler temperatures in Ranomafana and 
                Andasibe-Mantadia at night and early in the morning. We still recommend layers during 
                this time.
                </p>
                <h5>Regional Climate Differences</h5>
                <p>
                As part of the Hauts-Plateaux, Andasibe-Mantadia and Ranomafana are cooler than other 
                parts of the country, and the forest is humid, damp and under a thick overhead canopy 
                that shades the forest floor.
                Isalo National Park is typically sunny, hot and dry during our walks and pleasant in 
                the evenings (it can even be quite hot at night in October and November). Zombitse-
                Vohibasia National Park on the west coast is drier than either the east coast or the 
                central highlands because the trade winds lose their humidity by the time they reach 
                this region. The southwest and the extreme south are semidesert.
                Anjajavy, nestled along the Mozambican Channel, is not as dry, and the summer months 
                can be very hot, possibly reaching into the 100s°F.
                Sunscreen, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses and lightweight clothing are essential for 
                the second half of this adventure.
