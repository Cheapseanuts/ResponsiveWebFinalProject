                        At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi), Madagascar is the world's 47th largest 
                        country, the 2nd largest island country and the fourth-largest island. The country 
                        lies mostly between latitudes 12°S and 26°S, and longitudes 43°E and 51°E. 
                        Neighboring islands include the French territory of Réunion and the country of 
                        Mauritius to the east, as well as the state of Comoros and the French territory of 
                        Mayotte to the north west. The nearest mainland state is Mozambique, located to the west.

                        Antananarivo, also known by its colonial shorthand form ‘Tana’, is the capital and 
                        largest city of Madagascar. The administrative area of the city, known as 
                        Antananarivo-Renivohitra ("Antananarivo-Mother Hill" or "Antananarivo-Capital"), is 
                        the capital of Analamanga region. The city sits at 1,280 m (4,199 ft) above sea level 
                        in the center of the island, the highest national capital by elevation among the 
                        island countries. It has been the country's largest population center since at least 
                        the 18th century. The presidency, National Assembly, Senate and Supreme Court are 
                        located there, as are 21 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of many national 
                        and international businesses and NGOs. It has more universities, nightclubs, art 
                        venues, and medical services than any city on the island. Several national and local 
                        sports teams, including the championship-winning national rugby team, the Makis are 
                        based here.

                        In 2018, the population of Madagascar was estimated at 26 million, up from 2.2 
                        million in 1900. The annual population growth rate in Madagascar was approximately 
                        2.9 percent in 2009. Approximately 42.5 percent of the population is younger than 15 
                        years of age, while 54.5 percent are between the ages of 15 and 64. Those aged 65 and 
                        older form 3 percent of the total population. Only two general censuses, in 1975 and 
                        1993, have been carried out after independence. The most densely populated regions of 
                        the island are the eastern highlands and the eastern coast, contrasting most 
                        dramatically with the sparsely populated western plains.

                        The Malagasy language is of Malayo-Polynesian origin and is generally spoken 
                        throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally 
                        mutually intelligible, can be clustered under one of two subgroups: eastern Malagasy, 
                        spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of 
                        Antananarivo, and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains. 
                        French became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came 
                        under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy 
                        and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is 
                        a francophone country, and French is mostly spoken as a second language among the 
                        educated population and used for international communication.

                        The colors used in the flag represent the tradition, history, and culture of the 
                        country. The Merina Kingdom of Madagascar that ruled over the region prior to 
                        colonization by France used red and white as the traditional colors. These two colors 
                        were used in the flag of Queen Ranavalona III, one of the monarchs of the Merina 
                        kingdom. Thus, the use of these colors in the present-day flag of the country 
                        represents the nation’s history and the ethnic origin of the Malagasy people who 
                        arrived from southeast Asia. The colors are thus shared with the flag of Indonesia. 
                        The green color used in the flag represents the Hova people of the country who are 
                        the biggest class of peasant commoners. The Hova community is well-known for its 
                        important role in the independence movement of Madagascar.

                        Madagascar's financial sector is made up of 11 banks and several financial 
                        establishments and micro-finance institutions. Its currency has fairly stabilized 
                        over the last ten years indicating good tidings ahead. The official currency of 
                        Madagascar is called Ariary. It has the ISO standard code of MGA and is identified by 
                        the symbol “Ar.” The currency is subdivided into 5 iraimbilanja and is one of the two 
                        non-decimal currencies in circulation in the world today with the other being the 
                        Mauritanian ouguiya. The currency’s name was derived from pre-colonial currency, 
                        silver dollar. Iraimbilanja literally translates to “one iron weight” named after 
                        fifth worth of an ariary old coin. Malagasy Ariary replaced the franc as Madagascar’s 
                        official currency on January 1, 2005.

                                At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi), Madagascar is the world's 47th largest 
                                country, the 2nd largest island country and the fourth-largest island. The country 
                                lies mostly between latitudes 12°S and 26°S, and longitudes 43°E and 51°E. 
                                Neighboring islands include the French territory of Réunion and the country of 
                                Mauritius to the east, as well as the state of Comoros and the French territory of 
                                Mayotte to the north west. The nearest mainland state is Mozambique, located to the west.

                                in the center of the island, the highest national capital by elevation among the 
                                island countries. It has been the country's largest population center since at least 
                                the 18th century. The presidency, National Assembly, Senate and Supreme Court are 
                                located there, as are 21 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of many national 
                                and international businesses and NGOs. It has more universities, nightclubs, art

                                In 2018, the population of Madagascar was estimated at 26 million, up from 2.2 
                                million in 1900. The annual population growth rate in Madagascar was approximately 
                                2.9 percent in 2009. Approximately 42.5 percent of the population is younger than 15 
                                years of age, while 54.5 percent are between the ages of 15 and 64. Those aged 65 and 
                                older form 3 percent of the total population. Only two general censuses, in 1975 and 
                                1993, have been carried out after independence. The most densely populated regions of 
                                the island are the eastern highlands and the eastern coast, contrasting most

                                The Malagasy language is of Malayo-Polynesian origin and is generally spoken 
                                throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally 
                                mutually intelligible, can be clustered under one of two subgroups: eastern Malagasy, 
                                spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of 
                                Antananarivo, and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains. 
                                French became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came 
                                under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy 
                                and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is 
                                a francophone country, and French is mostly spoken as a second language among the 
                                educated population and used for international communication.

                                The colors used in the flag represent the tradition, history, and culture of the 
                                country. The Merina Kingdom of Madagascar that ruled over the region prior to 
                                colonization by France used red and white as the traditional colors. These two colors 
                                were used in the flag of Queen Ranavalona III, one of the monarchs of the Merina 
                                kingdom. Thus, the use of these colors in the present-day flag of the country 
                                represents the nation’s history and the ethnic origin of the Malagasy people who 
                                arrived from southeast Asia. The colors are thus shared with the flag of Indonesia. 
                                The green color used in the flag represents the Hova people of the country who are 
                                the biggest class of peasant commoners. The Hova community is well-known for its 
                                important role in the independence movement of Madagascar.

                                establishments and micro-finance institutions. Its currency has fairly stabilized 
                                over the last ten years indicating good tidings ahead. The official currency of 
                                Madagascar is called Ariary. It has the ISO standard code of MGA and is identified by 
                                the symbol “Ar.” The currency is subdivided into 5 iraimbilanja and is one of the two 
                                non-decimal currencies in circulation in the world today with the other being the 
                                Mauritanian ouguiya. The currency’s name was derived from pre-colonial currency, 
                                silver dollar. Iraimbilanja literally translates to “one iron weight” named after 
                                fifth worth of an ariary old coin. Malagasy Ariary replaced the franc as Madagascar’s
